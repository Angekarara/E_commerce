          <p><h3>Students who can effectively interact with their classmates, teachers, friends, and family will demonstrate personal development. Personal growth involves improvement in character and a generally healthy outlook in life. 
             When you communicate with others, you get the opportunity to learn about the different cultures of your classmates. This helps open your mind to different opinions and allows you to develop your character. 
            All this helps a student learn new values and build trust and develop a more positive outlook on life.</p>
          <p>For example, as a student, you will have to report your problems to your leaders, to study well
            and understand what you are studying and get good grades.</h3></p>

          <p><h3>Most times, a student lacks the confidence to communicate due to a speech impediment such as a stutter,
             or lack of fluency in the language.
            They might also feel self-conscious about their voice pitch or how they might pronounce some things.</h3> </p>
